# The repository of my final project on CS340 at American College at Thessaloniki (introduction to AI and ML using Python). The showcase of coding on Python and working with files as well as teaching the AI model.

This repository contains my final project for my college class in Introduction to Machine Learning on Python. 

The project consists of two parts: Part A is a simple warm-up on Python with a menu implemented that allows the user to manipulate the data from the file, including reading and writing from and to the file, calculating some statistics, adding new columns to the dataframe, building graphs, etc. This part mostly used the Pandas library to manipulate the data. 

Part B is a showcase of an artificial neural network mechanism written in Python using Scikit-learn, NumPy, and Pandas libraries for storing the data, classifying the MLP, and testing the MLP on testing data. All the functionalities are built into the menu for a better user experience. Also, one of the menu's options makes some tests with various configurations of the MLP to find the best combination of learning step rate, number of epochs, data split proportion, and topology for hidden layers. All the graphs are automatically saved in the specific folder, as well as the output data that is compiled during the run of the code in text files.

The final report describing the results of the project more precisely is also attached.
